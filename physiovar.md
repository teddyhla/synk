## Acuity Levels

Patients in hospital can have 4 levels of acuity. [NHS acuity levels](https://www.datadictionary.nhs.uk/attributes/critical_care_level.html)

Level 0 - normal ward patients
Level 1 - risk of deterioration
Level 2 - single organ support
Level 3 - multiple organ support

Level 0 and 1 can be on any ward, though usually Level 1 requires 'continuous monitoring of some sort'. There is no definition or standard. e.g., in ULCH, this can be PACU or AMU.

Level 2 and 3 - in the UCLH, all in critical care units. They will have more invasive monitoring and organ support.

## Monitoring Frequency

as above

## Measured variables

1. NEWS
- All patients will have NEWS measured except in critical care where this is in real time.
- NEWS include Heart rate, Blood pressure, Respiratory Rate, Oxygen Saturation, Temperature and Conscious levels.
UK we now use [NEWS2](https://www.england.nhs.uk/ourwork/clinical-policy/sepsis/nationalearlywarningscore/)

Variables and ranges
1.1. Respiratory Rate : 0 to 60+ 
1.2. Oxygen Saturation : 0 to 100
1.3. O2 scale 2 : 0 to 100
1.4. Air or Oxygen
1.5. Systolic Blood pressure: 40 to 300
1.6. Heart Rate(pulse) : 0 to 200
1.7. Temp : 35 to 40 

2. Additional Measured physiological variables
- Patients may have 'urine output' , or any body fluid output monitoring on any of level 0 to 3. E.g., insertion of drain into chest and measurement of chest drain output or from abdominal drain after intra-abdominal surgery.

3. Point-of-care measurement 
- As PRN, patients will have BM(Glucose) and/or ketones measurement 
- When unwell, venous or arterial blood gas measurement 

4. Laboratory tests
Commonly, in ITU (level 2 and 3) - daily bloods, and for haematology patients, daily
- elsewhere, every other day
- Full Blood count, Urea and Electrolytes, C-reactive protein, Bone Profile, Liver function tests, Thyroid Function Test, Troponin, Nt-proBNP, Creatine Kinase, LDH, Autoimmune screen, Blood borne virus screen
- Microbiology tests: Specimen Microscopy, Culture and Sensitivity (CSF, Sputum, drain output, Urine, Skin)
- Special tests (CSF analysis)

5. Critical Care Measurements

Airway : ETT tube cuff pressure
Breathing: Ventilator variables and respiratory mecahnics, ABG and SpO2
Circulation: HR, BP, Cap refill time, Temp, Cardiac output monitoring, Echo variables
Disability: RASS score, sedation levels, BM
E : Urine output 
F : 

## Scoring Systems

### NEWS2 
Each of the seven domain can score from 0 to 3 then added together.

### SOFA score
Each of the six domains can score from 0 to 4 and added together. 
PaO2/FiO2 ratio, Platelets, Bilirubin, Cadiovascular, GCS, Renal 

### qSOFA score 
only 3 domains, respiratory rate, GCS and blood pressure

### APACHE II score

## Physiological Formula and Derive Measurements

### Pulse Pressure and its cousins
Pulse Pressure = SBP - DBP
Pulse Pressure Variation = 


### Cardiac Output
1. Stewart Hamilton Equation
2. Fick Equation
